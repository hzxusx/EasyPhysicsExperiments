# EasyPhysicsExperiments
Useful python scripts oriented toward simplify the procedures on 
processing the data in physics experiments in University. 

+ DataProcessing.py
  A class to automatically caculate average, standard differences 
  and U_a(A类不确定度). It also provide most physics constant.
+ CombinedUncertainty.py
  Given uncertainty and average value of each varibles and expression
  of the result, produce the combined uncertainty. Unpackaged code yet.
  Module **Sympy** is required.
